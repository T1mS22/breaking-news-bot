# Breaking News Discord Bot
## This bot gets latest breaking news from "Tagesschau" and sends them into a specified discord channel.

First of all: create a discord bot and invite it on your discord server.

After that need to run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all needed dependencies.

Please create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project and in there add the following: `DISCORD_TOKEN=yourToken`.

A `Dockerfile` is also included so you can run your bot in a container.
